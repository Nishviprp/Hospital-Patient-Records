Hospital Patient Analytics Project – Massachusetts General Hospital (Synthetic Data, 2011–2022)

Tools & Skills: Excel (Advanced Analysis & Cleaning), SQL, Power BI 

Designed and executed a complete data analytics workflow on 500 + records of hospital patient, encounter, and procedure data to assess admissions, readmissions, cost trends, and insurance coverage over time.

Utilized SQL queries to integrate multi-table healthcare data (patients, encounters, procedures, payers, organizations) and compute key performance indicators such as average length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate, and average cost per visit.

Applied Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, transformation, and time-series aggregation; used Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize quarterly trends and uncover seasonal spikes in hospital admissions.

Built interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to communicate insights, highlighting patterns in high-cost encounters, coverage gaps, and payer-wise performance.

Delivered actionable findings that could help hospital management reduce readmission risk and optimize insurance coverage policies through data-driven decisions.

Demonstrated end-to-end capability in data preparation, SQL analytics, and visual storytelling to support strategic healthcare operations.
